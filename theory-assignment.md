### 1. What is Emmet?

Emmet is a free add-on for your text editor that allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code. Emmet short hand expression can be used to generate HTML markup and css. 

Some useful emmet abbreviations are :

HTML

1.Generating HTML Skeleton

The first thing you would do when creating a HTML page is create the skeleton for it, that is type DOCTYPE, html,head, body tags. Just type '!' or 'html:5' and Emmet will generate html5 boilerplate code like the one below.

### 2.What is CDN ? Why do we use it ?

CDN (Content Delivery Network) refers to geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of internet content.
They provide cached internet content from a network location closest to a user to speed up its delivery.

-at fundamental level CDN brings content closer to the user by deploying hundreds of servers all around the world. This server locations are called Point of Presence (PoPs). A server inside a PoP is commonly called Edge Server. Having many PoPs around the world ensures that any user can reach a fast edge server close to them.

### 3.Difference between library and framework ?

Library - collection of pre-defined helper functions, objects, classes, modules that can be used in code to boost the development. By using a library, you can control the flow of the application and call the library. Eg: React, JQuery, Lodash

Framework - Foundation upon which applications are built. In contrast, when you use a framework, the control is inverted, i.e., the framework controls the flow and calls your code. Eg: Node JS, Angular, Spring
